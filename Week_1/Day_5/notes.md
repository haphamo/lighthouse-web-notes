## Recursion
 - Recursion is an alternative to traditional looping that allows you to do the same thing, just in a slightly different way. Recursion isn't necessarily a better way of doing this, it's just a different way of doing this.

Recursive case: as long as this is true, the function will continue to call itself.
Base case: If this is true, the function will not call itself.

Recursion is a tool you can use as an alternative to traditional iteration using for and while loops.

1. Every recursive function must have a base case and a recursive case.
2. Each recursive call should break down the current problem into a smaller, simpler one.
3. The recursive calls must eventually reach the smallest version of the problem, the base case.
4. The base case is when the problem can be solved without further recursion.
