#Notes from the Quiz

Question 1:
- Library: an independent collection of code that can be used by programs (not JS specific)
- Module: JS code in a separate file, that can be required by other JS programs 
- Package: a collection of JS modules, with a package.json, usually published on NPM

Question 2+3
package.json file should be committed to a project's git repo because it contains the information necessary to recreate node_modules.
Not the node_modules! would be redundant and would cause giant git commits every time a library is updated.

Question 4

require() - would be redundant and would cause giant git commits every time a library is updated.
